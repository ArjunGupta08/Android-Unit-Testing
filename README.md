# Unit Testing
 - Helps in catching bugs.
 - Testing smallest piece of code.
 - Helps in writing modular codes - features can be added easily.

# Testing in Android -
 - We have `kotlin/java code (Pure Logic)` with `Android Framework`.
 - Having a good architecture helps in seggregating Android Code from pure kotlin/java logic.

# Two types of tests -
 - **Unit Tests** ->
   - JVM Test (Local Unit Tests)
   - On Device Tests (Instrumentation Tests)
     - Instrumentation Tests can also be classified in two types ->
     - UI Tests (Interaction With Views)
     - Non UI Tests (Context, Assset MAnager etc.)
